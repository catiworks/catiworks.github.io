Here is another Color Pop. And I have to admit I have a serious weakness for this one. I think to me personally. This may be my favorite one yet. I love her expression. Love her hair. Love her design. There's something about her that makes me feel so pleased whenever I look at her. I think perhaps it's also a lot of nostalgia that has to do with it, reminding me of a lot of old anime styles of series that I used to watch.

For the orange one, I really wanted her to look lively and also perhaps a bit sporty. A very feminine girl as well as one that could be like the main star of any kind of sports club. She looks like she could be for example great on track and field as well boxing. I hope you all like her to and as per usual, would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on her. And re-shares are as always super appreciated to. Which one of the color pops so far is your favorites?

Small side note to let you all once more know Color pop commissions are open for march and april. <3 10 - 15 euro depending on the amount of details in the character and your choice of colors of course. <3
